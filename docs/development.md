# ViralFlow - Development Documentation

For computing environments with ARM64 architecture the user should inform the `--arch arm64` flag into some commands.

## Installation

### AMD64

```bash
git clone -b develop https://github.com/WallauBioinfo/ViralFlow.git
cd ViralFlow/
micromamba env create -f envs/amd64.yml
micromamba activate viralflow
pip install -e .
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/unsquashfs /usr/local/bin/unsquashfs
viralflow build-containers
```

### ARM64

```bash
# install singularity
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential git wget pkg-config \
    libseccomp-dev squashfs-tools cryptsetup \
    libglib2.0-dev uuid-dev libssl-dev libgpgme-dev \
    libarchive-dev runc golang

git clone --recursive https://github.com/sylabs/singularity.git
cd singularity
git checkout v3.11.4
git submodule update --init --recursive
./mconfig
make -C builddir
sudo make -C builddir install

# install viralflow wrapper
git clone -b develop https://github.com/WallauBioinfo/ViralFlow.git
cd ViralFlow/
micromamba env create -f envs/arm64.yml
micromamba activate viralflow
pip install -e .

# build containers
viralflow build-containers --arch arm64
```

## Development quality checks

Python 3.12 is the supported development version. For a lightweight setup, use
`uv` to create the Python environment and install ViralFlow and `pre-commit`:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e . "pre-commit==4.6.0"
```

The Python test hook uses `uv` to create and cache its own Python 3.12
environment. Nextflow linting and the pre-push tests still require `nextflow` and
`nf-test` on `PATH`. Alternatively, both architecture-specific development
environments include Python 3.12, `pre-commit`, Nextflow, and nf-test.

Install both Git hook stages from the repository root:

```bash
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push
```

The pre-commit stage runs repository hygiene checks, Ruff linting and formatting,
Nextflow linting, and the Python unit tests. Hooks that modify files will fail the
first run so the updated files can be reviewed and staged again.

Run the complete commit-time suite manually with:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The pre-push stage runs the Nextflow tests that need no container image. Run it
manually with:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage pre-push
```

The rest of the suite needs a container image, so it is not part of either
pre-commit stage. With Singularity and a locally built
`vfnext/containers/baseContainer.sif`:

```bash
cd vfnext
NXF_VER=26.04.6 nf-test test \
  tests/workflows/bcftools-fixture.nf.test \
  tests/workflows/metadata-fixture.nf.test \
  --ci
NXF_VER=26.04.6 nf-test test integration_tests/nanopore-truth.nf.test --ci
```

Without Singularity — CI runners, and developer machines such as Apple Silicon
Macs — build the Docker image once and use `-profile docker` instead:

```bash
cd vfnext/containers
docker build -f nanopore_base.Dockerfile -t viralflow/nanopore-base:2.0.0a1 .
cd ..
NXF_VER=26.04.6 nf-test test tests/ --profile docker --ci
NXF_VER=26.04.6 nf-test test integration_tests/nanopore-truth.nf.test --profile docker --ci
```

GitHub Actions runs both of these on every pull request. The truth test pulls
Clair3, whose published image is amd64-only: it runs natively on CI runners, but
needs emulation on Apple Silicon and will be slow there.

For an emergency-only bypass, use `git commit --no-verify` or
`git push --no-verify`, then run the skipped hook stage manually before opening
or updating a pull request.

### Building the documentation

The site you are reading is Sphinx with MyST, so pages are Markdown.
`.readthedocs.yaml` at the repository root pins the Python and points Read the
Docs at `docs/conf.py`; `docs-es/` and `docs-pt/` are the Spanish and Portuguese
trees.

Adding a page takes two steps, not one. Dropping a `.md` file into `docs/` is
not enough — Sphinx only links a page into the sidebar if a `toctree` lists it,
and warns that the document "isn't included in any toctree" otherwise. Add the
file, then add its name (without the extension) to the `toctree` in
`docs/index.md`.

Build a tree locally with the same Python and requirements Read the Docs uses:

```bash
uv run --no-project --python 3.13 \
  --with-requirements docs/requirements.in \
  sphinx-build -b html -W --keep-going docs _build/docs
```

`-W` turns warnings into errors, which is what catches a page missing from a
toctree, a broken cross-reference, or a theme option the installed
`sphinx-rtd-theme` no longer accepts. CI runs exactly this command for `docs`,
`docs-es` and `docs-pt`. Read the Docs itself does not use `-W`, so a warning
degrades the published site rather than failing the build — which is the reason
to catch it here.

### Customizing snpEff catalog

#### AMD64

```bash
viralflow add-entry-to-snpeff --org-name Dengue --genome-code NC_001474.2
```

#### ARM64

```bash
viralflow add-entry-to-snpeff --org-name Dengue --genome-code NC_001474.2 --arch arm64
```
